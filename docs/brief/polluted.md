# Project Title
Polluted
# Project Description
Use a Raspberry Pi and sensors to acquire pollution levels on your way home. This idea is not new! But it is interesting. The Raspberry Pi is an incredible piece of kit. But the thing that makes it most amazing is its connectivity. We would like
you to connect sensors to a Pi to measure air pollution on your daily commute.
Your project will take you through the following process:
1. What is air pollution?
2. How do we measure it?
3. What is a Raspberry Pi?
4. How do I use it?
5. What sensors do I need?
6. How do I connect them?
7. What data do they produce?
8. How do I analyse it?
9. How do I transmit the data?
10. How do I display it?
11. How do I measure outside?
